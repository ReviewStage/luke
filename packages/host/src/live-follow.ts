/**
 * live-follow.ts -- a read the host follows over Neon Realtime, as Neon's guide says to: sealed statements subscribed to at the address the service names, and renewed before they expire.
 *
 * Each read is one or more parts, one sealed statement each, all on one
 * socket ("Subscribe to the sealed query"). Once every part has its first
 * result, every change of any part is the parts' rows whole, undecoded, for
 * the caller to decode at this boundary. Every seal is renewed ten seconds
 * before the earliest expires, a fetch that failed asked again a second
 * later, as Neon's own bindings renew ("Renew the sealed query"). The sealed
 * statements stay here, where the account's own bearer is; only what the
 * caller builds from the rows leaves.
