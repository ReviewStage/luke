# Agent guide

Luke is a macOS-first Electron sidecar that observes coding-agent sessions while
preserving existing provider workflows. Product naming belongs at the app and
packaging boundary; keep reusable implementation types brand-neutral.
Deployable products belong in `apps/`, and reusable packages belong in
`packages/`. Keep Electron main/preload code in `apps/desktop/` thin, keep the
renderer sandboxed, and put platform-independent behavior in
`packages/sidecar-core/`.

Canonical commands:

- `./scripts/bootstrap.sh` — install pinned workspace dependencies
- `./scripts/check.sh` — run portable repository, type, test, and build checks
- `./scripts/test-macos.sh` — package and validate the macOS app
- `./scripts/verify.sh` — complete macOS validation plus visual evidence
- `./scripts/run.sh` — launch the app against live sessions, replacing any
  running instance (`--fixture smoke` for fixture data, `--keep-running` to keep
  the running instance)
- `./scripts/evidence.sh` — write the fixture PNG under `artifacts/`
- `pnpm evidence:record` — record the fixture transition on a physical Mac
- `pnpm lint:fix` — apply repository formatting and safe lint fixes

Trust constraints:

- Never write provider transcripts or session-state files. Reading them is what
  Luke is for; writing to them is never.
- Never inject terminal input, simulate keystrokes, or request Accessibility.
- Product behavior must not require provider MCP, plugins, hooks, wrappers,
  credentials, or live sessions. A provider whose sessions exist only in a cloud
  service may read a user-supplied API key, but it must observe nothing until
  the user supplies one, must never write through that credential, and must
  leave every other provider working without it.
- Keep unsupported capabilities explicit; do not invent fallback controls.
- Keep Electron renderers sandboxed with context isolation and narrow IPC.
- Commit only synthetic fixtures and repository-relative paths. This binds
  harder as Luke observes more: a fixture copied from a real session now carries
  a real title, branch, and recap.

What Luke may show:

- Show whatever the local surface can read. A session's own title, branch,
  model, current tool, failure, and the recap a provider wrote about it all
  belong on the row: a sidecar that cannot tell two sessions apart is not worth
  the space beside the housing. This is the user's own data, on the user's own
  screen, and it is read-only.
- Label a session by what its provider named it, falling back to the workspace
  or repository only when there is no name yet. Do not compose a sentence in an
  adapter; report the fields and let the surface word them.
- An evaluator is the one place session material leaves the machine, so it is
  the one place with a narrower rule. It receives `AttentionContext` — what a
  provider wrote *about* a session — and never the transcript behind it: no
  message history, file contents, or command output. Widening that set is a
  product decision, not an implementation detail; make it deliberately.

Before handoff, run `./scripts/check.sh` for portable-only changes. For any
macOS or UI change, `./scripts/verify.sh` is the completion invariant. Report
exact results; UI changes also require inspection of the visual evidence and a
note stating whether a physical-notch check was performed. CI links generated
evidence from the pull request description. Attach physical-device screenshots
or recordings through GitHub's PR editor; do not commit generated evidence or
one-off QA worksheets. Keep generated state and private planning files
untracked.

Biome is the executable style policy for TypeScript, JavaScript, JSON,
Markdown, and CSS. Husky runs the same checks against staged files as a local
convenience; `./scripts/check.sh` and CI remain authoritative.

## Git workflow

- Follow [Conventional Commits
  1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages.
- Format PR titles as `type[(scope)]: description`, using the matching type
  (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, etc.).
- For Linear work, use its suggested branch name when available and the ticket
  ID as the scope: `feat(LUKE-123): add Codex support`.

## Panel motion

The window is a stage; the drawn surface is the shape. A window therefore holds
the largest shape its mode can draw — a compact window holds the peek, so
hovering costs no IPC at all — plus `SURFACE_MARGIN` on every side, which is
what the spring overshoots into and the shadow falls in. Anything the shape does not cover is
transparent and must stay click-through, so hit regions track the shape rather
than the window.

The window never animates its own frame. An animated `setBounds` re-lays out
the whole renderer on every frame, because the panel is anchored to the
viewport's centre. Everything layered on the surface must move with `transform`
and `opacity` only — animating width, height, padding, or font-size on the
wings, the count badge, or the rows re-shapes text on every frame and is what
makes the motion stutter.

The surface is opaque in every state — it has to pass for part of a physical
object, and nothing behind the window may show through it — and takes its
shadow and hairline edge once it has grown past the housing. The panel's
shadow is delayed until the shape settles, because a blurred shadow repaints on
every frame that resizes the element; the peek's is small enough to ride along.
`backdrop-filter` is not an option: a transparent window has no backdrop to
sample, so it would buy a render surface on the animating element and return
nothing.

One spring for everything that moves. `--spring` drives the surface;
`--spring-fast` is the same damping ratio at a higher frequency for small
elements like the tab thumb, so the bounce profile is identical and only the
scale differs. Panel content arrives as one stack: the tab bar is index 0 and
each row below it starts further up, so the gaps spring open rather than the
rows sliding in as a block. The fan and the stagger stop accumulating past
`--row-fan-limit`, because only about five rows are ever on screen.

In either direction the shape and its content must not cross, or content is
left drawn on the desktop: growing, the surface leads and content follows;
shrinking, content leaves over `--duration-exit` before the surface moves.
`setWindowMode` owns the ordering for every caller — the panel, the tray, and
the motion recorder alike. `COLLAPSE_ANIMATION_MS` is the sum of
`--duration-exit` and `--duration-shape`; the three move together.

## TypeScript value sets and keys

- Do not use stringly typed fixed value sets. Define `as const`
  SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE objects, derive unions with
  `typeof VALUE_SET[keyof typeof VALUE_SET]`, and use the constants at call
  sites. Raw strings are only for freeform, user-facing text.
- Do not construct keys by concatenating or interpolating identifiers. Use
  nested objects or nested `Map` instances keyed by the original identifiers.
