# ADR 0001: Effect as the infrastructure library

Status: proposed. This stub records the two decisions the compatibility spike
settled and the one measurement it took; the full record (the shim list and
its deletion schedule, the idioms the migration writes to) lands with the
migration's documentation PR.

## Version line

`effect` is pinned at `3.22.2`, the newest 3.x release, through the pnpm
catalog in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and nowhere else. Every workspace that reaches
it declares `"effect": "catalog:"`, so one version resolves across the
repository, which is what keeps a `Context.Tag` minted in one package the same
service in another; `repository-checks.sh` refuses a literal version. Today
that is `@sidecar/wire`'s development dependency alone, for the spike test at
`packages/wire/src/effect-spike.test.ts`, which exercises `Schema.Struct`
decoding, `Effect.gen`, `Layer`, and `Context.Tag` under the repository's own
test runner.

The spike compiled under both TypeScript lines the repository carries:
`typescript@7.0.2` with `@types/node@26.2.0` (every package) and
`typescript@6.0.3` with `@types/node@22.20.1` (`apps/web`). The latter was
checked with a throwaway tsconfig extending `tsconfig.base.json` under
`apps/web`, naming the spike file alone, so `apps/web`'s own compiler and its
own `@types/node` resolved it.

## Effect 4

Effect 4 is not adopted. Its release line was a release candidate when this was
written, and the companion packages the migration depends on (`@effect/platform`,
`@effect/sql`, `@effect/rpc`) each ship a stable line against 3.x only. The
decision is re-evaluated when Effect 4 has a stable release and all three ship
4-compatible stable lines; until then every package pins the 3.x catalog entry.

## `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`

The flag was trialled in `tsconfig.base.json` against the whole workspace, with
each error counted once by the file it lives in, since every project compiles
its dependencies' sources and would otherwise report the same error from
several packages. It is not enabled here; whether to enable it and fix the
errors, or to have every Effect Schema spell `Schema.optionalWith(..., { exact:
true })` instead, is decided by the migration's follow-up PR on this count.

| Workspace | Errors |
| --- | --- |
| packages/providers | 41 |
| apps/web | 35 |
| apps/desktop | 30 |
| packages/host | 26 |
| packages/brain | 15 |
| packages/voice | 15 |
| packages/credentials | 7 |
| packages/session | 5 |
| packages/hosted | 4 |
| packages/settings | 4 |
| packages/wire | 2 |
| packages/actions | 1 |
| packages/analytics | 1 |
| packages/calendar | 1 |
| packages/panel | 1 |
| **Total** | **188** |

The other 18 workspaces reported none of their own. By diagnostic: 104 are
`TS2379` (an argument carrying `undefined` into an optional property), 37 are
`TS2412` (an assignment of `undefined` to an optional property), 35 are
`TS2375` (an object literal carrying `undefined` into one), and the remaining
12 are `TS2345`, `TS2322`, `TS2420`, and `TS2769`. Two of the errors sit in
`packages/wire/src/schema.ts` and are re-reported by every package that
compiles it.
